# Brooklyn-Housing-Price-Prediction

Housing market is one of the more volatile markets. Here we are analyzing changes in the house
prices in the Brooklyn region specifically for single family residences and condominiums in Q3
and Q4 of 2020. We have modeled a linear regression based on the housing data from 2016-2020
which is able to explain 63.32% variance in the sales prices while considering relevant variables
which could be the reason for price differences. The model is further used to predict prices for Q3
& Q4 of 2020 and conduct a statistical test to determine changes in group means between the two.
It is found that the results are unclear.
